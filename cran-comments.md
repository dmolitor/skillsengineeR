## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a web reference for the API in the form <https:.....> to the
description of the DESCRIPTION file with no space after 'https:' and
angle brackets for auto-linking.

* Enclosed all package names, software names and API names in single quotes in the title and description.

* Added \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explained the function results in the documentation.

## Test environments

* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
