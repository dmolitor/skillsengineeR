The goal of skillsengineeR is to provide a convenient wrapper around the 
[SkillsEngine](https://skillsengine.com/) API. skillsengineeR provides functions for each
API endpoint and returns friendly output in the form of lists and data.frames.
It also performs basic error checking to ensure the user has entered queries
in the expected format, and provides functions that guide the user through the steps
of securely setting up API authorization keys.
